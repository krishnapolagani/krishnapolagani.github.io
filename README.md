**Personal Website — www.rkpolagani.com**

This repository hosts the source code for rkpolagani.com, the personal website of Ramakrishna (RK) Polagani.
The site showcases my professional background, skills, projects, travel experiences, sports interests, and contact information.
It is built using pure HTML, CSS, and small JavaScript enhancements, and deployed through GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

**HTML5** — Static, fast-loading content  
**CSS3** — Custom responsive layout, Apple-style gradients, glass effects, and design tokens  
**JavaScript** — Light interactivity (theme toggle, scroll reveal animations, parallax effects)  
**GitHub Pages** — Hosting + free SSL  
**Custom Domain** — rkpolagani.com
