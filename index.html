            I help engineering, manufacturing, quality and IT teams connect their product data
            from early design all the way to manufacturing and change. My focus is on building
            a reliable digital thread across PLM, ERP, ALM, MES and QMS so decisions are based
            on clean, consistent and traceable information.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is also a personal project where I design and build everything myself
            using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="card-subtitle">Who I am and how I work.</p>

        <p>
          I am a PLM Techno-functional Architect and Business Systems Analyst with more than
          fourteen years of experience delivering PLM implementations and integrations across
          medical devices, hi-tech, aerospace, semiconductor, industrial equipment, consumer goods
          and healthcare.
        </p>

        <p>
          My core strengths are in Siemens Teamcenter, Oracle Agile PLM,
          PTC Windchill and MechWorks PDM, combined with hands on integration work
          using T4X and T4O, Oracle Fusion Middleware, APIs and
          Power Platform. I design integration patterns that connect PLM with
          ERP systems such as Oracle EBS, Syspro, SAP and Microsoft Dynamics,
          as well as ALM, MES and QMS, to create a reliable digital thread.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am comfortable working between business and IT: leading workshops, clarifying requirements,
          running fit gap analysis and then working with technical teams to make sure solutions are practical,
          testable and supportable. I like simplifying complex landscapes and aligning tools, data and processes
          so teams can focus on delivery instead of constantly firefighting integrations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside work I enjoy travelling and following sports. Both of these influence how I think about teamwork,
          resilience and continuous improvement when working with cross functional and global teams.
